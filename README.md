# AWS EC2 Dashboard

This is a simple web-based dashboard that allows you to fetch and display information about your Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances. You can use this dashboard to retrieve EC2 instance details by providing your AWS access key, secret key, and the AWS region.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this dashboard, you need to have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account.
- AWS Access Key and Secret Key for authentication.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AWS EC2 Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

3. Fill out the form on the web page with the following information:
   - **Access Key:** Your AWS Access Key.
   - **Secret Key:** Your AWS Secret Key.
   - **Region:** The AWS region where your EC2 instances are located (e.g., `ap-south-1`).

4. Click the "Fetch EC2 Instances" button to retrieve the EC2 instance details for the specified region.

**Note:** Make sure to keep your AWS Access Key and Secret Key secure, and do not share them publicly. It is recommended to use IAM roles and policies for better security practices in a production environment.

## Features
